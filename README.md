# Heart-Disease-Prediction-Model
  
  The project involves building a heart disease prediction model using logistic regression. The model is then deployed using Flask, a lightweight web framework in Python. Postman is used to test the deployed model by sending a POST request with the required input parameters and receiving the predicted output as a response.
